Alice in DemonLand 

“There’s more to life than training. There’s love, Alice Blackburn. And you are in desperate need of it...” 

In the last millennia a deadly game has raged between demons and their half-human creations, called Moths. A century ago select Moths were born with distinctive marks on the backs of their hands. It was soon discovered that those with the marks possessed the same powers as their demon parent. Over the years an elite group of warriors formed The Dark Moth Society. 
Alice Blackburn is a Dark Moth trainee. Some of her classmates call her the Queen of Hearts, but only because she doesn’t share hers. There isn’t time. Not for fun and especially not for Kade Everett, the injured warrior she is required to help. In just a few days, her creator, the foul demon that killed her mom will come to kill her. That’s part of the game after all. And when he does, she will end him.



One
Down the Demon Hole

Everyone had a favorite game. Mine involved slaying underling demons. And I was antsy, ready to start. Our trainer, a Dark Moth warrior by the name of Peter didn’t care. He kept going on and on in his monotone about the demon order in the Underworld. As though where we lived, deep below Wonderland, Arizona was any better. The worst part was we’d heard the same speech more at least a dozen times over the years. He needed to shut up already so I could slay me some demons. 
“You know of the seven deadly sins?”
“Yes,” we all said in unison. 
“Well not only are they scary stories told in Sunday School, they are also living, breathing demon royalty…” 
Blah. Blah. Blah.
“The demons you’ll be fighting today are called underlings.” Peter pointed at the cage on the other side of the large instruction room. The cage had been fortified by troll magic. Every time a demon tried to slip between two of the metal bars, they were burned. 
A hundred of the little buggers growled, gnashed their teeth, and threw themselves against the rods, making the air reek of burning demon hair and flesh. Not a pleasant scent when they already smelled like rotting eggs mixed with decaying corpse. They didn’t look much better, resembling sewer rats with leprosy. Their skin appeared to be peeling off and oozed snot-looking liquid.  
“They’re fast and tricky. Killing them is easy, if you can catch them. Don’t use your weapons unless you’re sure you have a clean shot. Otherwise you’ll wind up sticking the end of a blade into another trainee. Got it?” Peter gave me a direct look. “Alice, what did I just say?” 
I forced myself not to roll my eyes. Peter was a great Dark Moth warrior, but his father had been a Pride demon, which meant he had an inordinately high opinion of himself. 
“Be careful when using your weapons. The underlings are tricky.” My weapon of choice was a katana, but I also kept a small dagger in my right boot and a 9mm in a holster under my shirt.
“Very good.” Gray eyes that exactly matched the rest of the Dark Moth trainees studied me. I was an oddity in many ways, but the most prominent was my eye color, which was bright blue. 
“Queen of Hearts,” the guy on my right whisper-coughed. 
Everyone around him snickered. 
“Quiet!” Peter’s angry voice boomed. Even the demons stopped chattering. “There will be no name calling. Use your energy and focus.” The tension in the room shot up. “This isn’t a game…” he began and then trailed off, a giant smile replacing his anger. “What am I saying? Of course it is.” 
The half dozen trainees behind me cheered, hooting and hollering excitedly. Because, it was a game. One our parents started thousands of years ago. 
Their rules were simple: Bed a human. Wait until after their half-demon child was born. Kill the human parent. Once the child reached the age of maturity, which was twenty-one, the real fun began. At least according to the demon. They would start hunting and wouldn’t stop until the child and everyone the half-demon cared about was dead. 
It was awesome, said no one ever, including me. I wasn’t going to let some filthy demon hunt me down in its twisted game. Instead I intended to take the fight to him. Well, in a manner of speaking. The other trainees knew from which demon they came. They found out by the color of their marks when their abilities manifested. If their demon parent were Pride, like Peter’s, then their marks would become purple. Greed was gold. Those from a Lust demon had their marks turn pink. Envy was green. Gluttony demons produced orange markings. Wrath became red. And, Sloth half-demons had their markings turn blue. The marks on the backs of my hands had been black since the day I was born. They hadn’t changed colors, even when my abilities manifested. 
It was yet another odd thing about me. 
All Dark Moth trainees wanted to see our demon parent dead. Killing him was how we proved ourselves, how we became full-fledged warriors. Most half-demons, called Moths, were born without any extra powers. We were the elite, born with power equivalent to that of our demon father. If we survived the encounter with the demon, then we became Dark Moth warriors whose destinies were to fight for those Moths without the marks. We would become their protectors, their light in the darkness. That was what the Dark Moth Society did. It was why we were all in the compound preparing to kill as many underling demons as possible. 
Practice for the real thing. 
“And the winner gets a night off above ground,” Peter said. 
“Oh yeah. Watch out Wonderland, here I come,” Steven said.
Peter chuckled. Walked over to the cage. Unlocked the pad lock. “In three. Two. One.” He jerked open the door. The underlings flooded out, stepping on and clawing each other to get at us. 
I ran forward, pulling my katana from its sheath and driving it at the leading underling. Before it connected the demon darted to the right and landed on top of Pamela, pulling her hair and digging his claws into her face. 
“Hold still, you writhing little rat.” I brought my blade down across the demon’s neck, slicing it in two. Green blood spattered my face and got all over Pamela before it turned into a pile of dark ash. 
Neither of us was fazed. “Thanks, Alice.” She spun, pulling an arrow from her quiver and sinking it into the stomach of the nearest demon. “Blue,” she shouted. 
I went after two demons, cutting one of the underlings in half while sinking the blade from my boot into the eye of another. “Red and pink. That’s three for me.”
The others were counting too even though Wrythe, the ruler of our society would decide the winner. 
Eric and Wendy worked together, which wasn’t surprising given they were a couple. Eric would bait the demons and Wendy would slaughter them. Then they would switch it up. I wondered if they fought together hoping for a tie so they both would be able to go above ground.
I didn’t care whether I went into Wonderland or not. My goal wasn’t to have fun. All that mattered was I get plenty of practice so that when my demon father appeared to kill me on my twenty-first birthday I would be ready. 
Still it was great practice and I quickly took out five more.  
“Alice, save some for the rest of us.”
“Not a chance, Georgia.” I smirked. The girl was greedy, but then she was the half-demon offspring of Greed.
“Tell me something, Alice. If you win, what do you intend to do with your prize?” 
“Enjoy it,” I responded. 
She used her double-edged axe to kill another two demons. “Guess I better make sure you don’t win.” 
“If you think you can.” I sliced through three more at once and stabbed another in the stomach. Then I spun around and cut through two before noticing four of the underlings on Gilbert. He fell to one knee as one of the demons bit off Gilbert’s ear. 
Gilbert screamed as deep red blood dripped from the wound. 
I aimed and tossed my knife at the demon. The blade sunk deep between the demon’s beady eyes. The demon fell off Gilbert, taking another of them with him to the ground. I ran forward and sliced through both. 
“It’s over,” Peter’s loud voice boomed. “Do we have our winner?” He glanced over at Wrythe, who nodded. 
“We do. Bring the trainees forward,” the king commanded.  
 



Two
The Pool of Winners

I came forward as did the others, except Gilbert who was being examined by Heathcliff. Heathcliff was the Society’s doctor. 
When we were all lined up, Wrythe stood and we each took a knee, placing a fist over our hearts. He walked our line, resting a gloved hand on each of our shoulders before moving on, even waiting until Gilbert was able to join us.   
I looked on in awe. The king was an ominous man. Describing him did him no justice. He stood six feet seven inches tall, the same as every other male warrior. His eyes shone dark gray and he had the same hair color too, which was ebony. Yet on him it was as though every feature, every muscle and sinew had lined up flawlessly. In truth, he was nearly too gorgeous to look at. 
His markings were deep red, the color of the Wrath demon. He possessed an exceedingly strong note of anger. It seemed to boil through him, like a living creature just beneath his skin. Just being close to him was intimidating. It was apparent in the way he held his shoulders that he knew he was meant to be king, that he was right where he belonged. I wondered what that felt like. To know without a doubt where you fit in. 
 Once he’d walked the line twice, Wrythe stopped in front of Eric. “Rise, trainee.” 
Eric stood, keeping his eyes on the ground. 
“You fought like a champion this evening. You will be a fine warrior.” He patted Eric on the shoulder. 
Then his gaze fell to Pamela. “Stand.” 
Pam rolled her shoulders as she straightened. All female Moths were a foot shorter than the males, so she tilted her chin up to meet his gaze. I internally rolled my eyes. “Your Highness.”   
“It is apparent you were sired by a Pride demon.” He touched her arm. “You’ll have much to overcome. Take care to school your prideful thoughts lest they get the better of you.” A small sigh escaped her lips. 
He gave her a grim smile. “Still, there is hope. You fought well.” 
He spoke a few words to each of the other trainees until he reached me. “Hello, Alice.” He held out his hand to help me stand even though I didn’t need it. For the longest moment he studied me. I worried I’d done something wrong. Then he said, “You aren’t like the rest of them.” He flipped over my hand so he could get a better look at the markings on my wrists. “Haven’t you reached maturity?” 
“I have. When I’m fighting I feel the power, but my markings haven’t changed color.” 
Peter stood to the right of me. “Between the lack of color on her markings and her eyes, we aren’t sure which demon is her sire.”
Wrythe leaned in so close I could smell the sandalwood scent of his aftershave. “I’ve seen rare cases where the demon’s genetics are revealed through eye color, which would make her a…”
He paused and moved even closer. My eyes wanted to cross, but I held his gaze, hoping he would be able to give a solid answer. Perhaps my demon sire was a Sloth, but there where certain times that my eyes would change from blue-green to green-blue, so did that make my sire a Greed demon then?
“The other trainers and I have discussed it and can’t say for certain. She doesn’t fight like a Sloth demon.” 
“No, she most certainly does not. I would guess Wrath by her aggressiveness.” He seemed satisfied with that guess. 
“We’ve considered Greed as well, but she doesn’t display a Greed demon’s appetites.”
“I would also agree based on what I’ve seen tonight.” He straightened. “You’re a mystery, Alice Blackburn.” He crossed his arms in front of his bulky chest, causing his rippling muscles to flex under his black shirt. “You’re also tonight’s winner. Congratulations.” He clapped and the others joined in even though I could see by the looks on their faces that they weren’t thrilled. 
 “Thank you, sir.” I bowed at the waist, locking eyes on his black combat boots.
“What do you intend to do tonight?” 
“Uh,” I glanced at the other trainees. “Would you mind if I invited everyone to go up into Wonderland with me?” 
His brows crunched together. 
“That wasn’t the agreement,” Peter said, but I figured it wouldn’t hurt to try. 
“It’s true. But,” Wrythe smiled a large, genuine smile that lit up his face and flashed his straight teeth. “I like your style, Alice.” He walked to the exit where he pushed open the door. “Yes, I think that would be an excellent idea.” He gave Peter a pointed look. “Go with them. They deserve the break.” 
Peter nodded. “Yes. Of course.”
“Besides, I believe it’s Eric’s birthday?”
Eric lifted his head a bit higher. “It is.”
“Well then it’s more than settled. Be sure to eat some cake for me too.”  



Three
Group Bonding

Birthdays weren’t exactly happy for us Moths, especially when it was our twenty-first, like it was Eric’s. That was because our demon parent officially began its hunt to kill their offspring on this day. The Dark Moth Society’s ruler knew what today meant. For that reason I was surprised Wrythe had agreed to let him go above ground. 
Though it was well known that the demon rarely came after his offspring on their actual birthday. That would be too easy. And the demons hunted us for sport. It was fun for them. They’d discovered eons ago that they could do it, so they did. We were nothing more than entertainment. 
They impregnated human women without their knowledge, forced them to carry the Moth child to term, and once born, terminated the mother. It was heartless, cruel, and evil. 
Normally the demon would allow the Moth to worry and fret a week or two before showing up. 
“I don’t think we should go,” I said to Wendy while I watched her apply her makeup. She looked pretty in black heels, skinny jeans, and a red silk halter-top. She’d curled her dark hair and it lay against her creamy skin in a halo of soft curls. For makeup she’d done smoky eyes in dark gray and black and then applied red lipstick that matched her top as well as her markings. 
During dinner, the others had talked excitedly about what they wanted to do. The plan was to go to a club called The Mad Hatter. It was rumored to be a lot of fun, not that any of us had a lot of experience with the term. We’d been training within the compound since we were twelve. It was our school, our training facility, and the only home most of us cared to remember.
“Of course we’re going to go, A—” she paused and took in my outfit. 
I had on dark jeans, my old black combat boots, and a black tank top. After my shower, I’d brushed out my hair and put some mousse in it figuring I’d let it air dry. My makeup consisted of nothing, unless I counted the lotion I’d applied.  
“Is that what you’re wearing?” 
I glanced down. “Yeah?” 
She shook her head. “You’re lucky you have those weird eyes. At least they provide a pop of color.” She grabbed her bag and stuck a knife in it.
“I seriously doubt they’ll let you bring a weapon into the club.” I didn’t tell her about the knife hidden in my boot. 
She laughed, pulling it from her bag. “Old habits die hard.” She set it on the tall oak dresser we shared and headed toward the door.
“With Eric’s birthday, I don’t think it’s—” 
Wendy held up her hand, cutting me off. “Look, I know you’re the Queen of Hearts and that you don’t care about the rest of us.” She went over to her jewelry box, found a necklace, and put it on. “Not really, anyway. “But Eric is my boyfriend. Tonight is his birthday. And since you won the challenge you have to come.” She stomped one of her healed feet as her markings flashed deep red. “So get off your butt and let’s go.” 
“Fine.” I hated it when the others called me the Queen of Hearts, probably because the nickname fit. But not the way they thought. 
That was my biggest secret: my heart overflowed with emotions and feelings. I cared too much. More than I should. I fought to protect my heart because caring hurt, more than they could know. 
As we walked down the hall, we met Pam and Georgia. They both looked great as well. Georgia in a bright yellow sundress and Pam in a plum poplin top and white pants. 
We turned the corner and opened the door to the guys’ hallway. They were waiting by the elevator, all dressed in variations of the same outfit: Jeans and button-up shirts. Eric wore green, Gilbert had on orange, Steve looked nice in blue, and Leif wore pink. 
Eric’s eyes lit up as soon as he saw Wendy. 
“You look gorgeous,” he said hugging her. 
“Thanks.” 
The rest of us tried to pretend we were invisible while they kissed. 
Finally Steve had had enough. “Let’s go.” 
“We can’t yet. We need to wait for Peter.” I faced the door that led to the teachers’ quarters just as Peter appeared with the key that would unlock the elevator and take us up. Up into the real world, the one where we were hunted like animals. 
Usually Peter wore all black. Tonight he had on faded jeans and a purple tee shirt. He’d showered and pulled his long black hair back with a tie at the nape of his neck. 
“You clean up nice,” Pamela said, sidling closer to him. 
“So do you,” he responded with appreciation. 
That surprised all of us. He took in our shocked faces and chuckled. “What? I’m not allowed to have fun? I need to stick to babysitter duties?”
I hadn’t thought about that. To me, Peter was a teacher, someone way out of my league, but he was probably only a few years older than the rest of us. 
“Oh no. You should definitely have some fun,” Pam said, giving him a sultry smile. 
“How about I find a happy medium.” He took a set of keys from his pocket, inserted a strange circular shaped one into the keyhole just below the button that had an up arrow and turned it to the right. 
A motor kicked on and after several long moments the doors pinged open. Silently, we road up. It seemed to take an hour, but was probably closer to five minutes. When the door opened again, we stepped out into a parking garage. 
“Welcome to Wonderland, Arizona. Population 17, 275,” Peter said, spinning in a circle.  
I was the last one out and gulped down the dry, hot air. It took my breath away. Even at eleven o’clock at night, the heat was stifling. “So where’s this club?” I asked, longing to turn around and go back.
“What’s the matter Queen of Hearts? Can’t take a little heat?” Leif lightly punched me in the arm. 
He was trying to be cute and flirty. It wasn’t working. I punched him back not so lightly. “I just want to get this fun over with.” 
Peter faced us. “Huddle up,” he said, sounding like the coach in a football game. 
When we all faced him he said, “There are three rules. One: Watch out for each other. If you see a trainee in trouble, help them out. Two: Don’t use your abilities on non-Moths. Leave the humans alone. And three, if we lose one another, this is our meeting spot.” He gave each of us a serious look, gauging how well we were listening. “We won’t return to the compound until we have everyone. Got it?”
“Got it, boss,” Steve said. 
“Keep your eyes peeled. Check out your surroundings. If something looks out of place, let me know.” 
I gave Peter a mental snort. Didn’t he realize it all looked out of place to us? I didn’t know for sure, but I was pretty positive none of us had been above ground in at least a year.  
   



Four
The Mad Hatter 

Several blocks before we reached the club I could feel the music. It seemed to bring the ground to life, causing it to shake. Movie posters of The Avengers, The Huger Games, and The Duff lined a bus stop. We walked past a Barnes and Noble, a store with a weird apple sign, and a grocery store called Winegar’s before turning into an alley. 
“Stay close,” Peter said as though the homeless humans littering the concrete walls like garbage could hurt us.
A man held out his hand. “Spare a dollar?” he asked. 
I touched Peter’s arm. “Do you have a dollar I can give him?” 
He chuckled and kept walking. It was apparent he had no intention of giving the guy any money. “You have been out of touch with the real world for way too long. There should be a class that teaches you how to live in the real world. You won’t be down in the compound forever.” 
That’s only if we don’t die, I thought as we rounded the corner. 
It was evident which building housed the club. A long line of people stood waiting to get in. Steve headed toward the end of the line. 
“Stick together,” Peter said, grabbing him by the shirt. He walked up to the bouncer. The big guy took off his sunglasses even though it was way to dark to be wearing them in the first pace. Peter and the guy talked for a few seconds before the guy put his shades back on. Then proceeded to unhook the velvet rope and let us walk in. 
Those still waiting shouted obscenities and grumbled. Someone even threw an empty can. I heard it coming and caught it in mid air, then turned, searching the crowd for the culprit. No one came forward, which was probably for the best, so I tossed the can in the trash and walked inside. 
The temperature immediately went from stuffy hot to positively chilly. A light mist sprayed the room giving it a smoky quality. It caused the colorful ceiling lights to linger in the air. Bodies writhed and moved on the dance floor to the beat of some kind of electro-techno crap. The other seven had taken over a couple of tables. A waitress came over and took their orders. The waitress checked IDs. Eric was the only one old enough for alcohol. 
With us, it didn’t matter. The demon DNA we possessed made it so alcohol metabolized and burned up before we were effected. It was the same with drugs. Good thing we healed fast and didn’t get sick. When we were wounded though, we just had suffer through the pain.  
Peter moved to stand beside me. “Why don’t you go over and hang out with them?”
“I… In a minute.” It was hard to explain how little I fit in. “Why aren’t you over there?” I decided to turn the question back on him. 
“Well, I’m the teacher. Not an equal or an ally, but a superior. Going over there will only make them uncomfortable.” He crossed his hands behind his back. 
“I guess that makes sense.” I wondered if he had any friends.
Eric and Wendy got up and began dancing, their bodies twining together like two pieces of the same rope. Eric leaned in and kissed her neck causing Wendy to giggle. Leif flirted with the waitress when she brought back the drinks. Steve and Gilbert were speaking to a couple of girls at the next table. Georgia and Pam chatted and laughed, swaying to the music. It was sweet seeing them laughing, enjoying themselves, and doing something besides training. 
A small part of me felt envious. 
“But you should totally get over there,” Peter continued. “I mean, I know what they call y—” He didn’t finish. 
I glanced up at him. “Peter, what is it?” I followed his gaze. There was a man walking along the outskirts of the club, like a cougar, he hunted for something. Or someone, I thought and immediately froze. He looked like the actor from a movie we’d just watched about an alien superhero. Thor, my mind said. 
He was tall, with bulging muscles straining against an expensive suit. The man had long blond hair that he let hang free and wore a ring that glittered against the lights on his left middle finger.  
Who are you hunting? But before I finished thinking the question, I knew the answer. He was an Envy demon, which meant he was there for Eric. 
“Peter, he’s a demon.” 
“I know.” He faced me. “Calmly go over to the group and tell them to head back to our spot.” 
“And what are you going to do?” 
“I’m going after it.” His dark eyes shimmered with anger. “Now do as I say.” 
I jumped forward, then slowed my pace, keeping my heart rate even, in case he the demon was listening. 
“Alice, glad you could join us,” Leif said, reaching out to hug me.
I sidestepped him and went over to Wendy and Eric. 
“Alice, what is it?” Eric gave me a questioning glance. 
“He’s here. Your demon sire.” I figured it was best to get straight to the point. 
“No, he can’t be,” Wendy said, but I smelled the fear on her. 
“It’s true. We need to go. Peter wants us to meet at the garage. Help me gather the others.” 
“No, if he’s here for me, I have to stay and fight. I can’t put anyone else in danger.” As he spoke he looked at Wendy. 
I reached out and touched Eric’s arm. “That’s honorable and I know that’s what we’ve been trained to do, but you aren’t prepared. You have no weapons. We should do as Peter said. Regroup and then we can help you go after the demon.” 
“Dammit.” He punched his fist into the table, causing it to split in two. 
“What’s wrong,” Leif asked. 
“Envy demon. He’s here for Eric. We need to take off.” I searched the perimeter for the guy and easily found him. He had his slimy hand on a supermodel tall, blonde girl. They were talking. She started to head toward the exit when the demon looked directly at me. His dark eyes seemed to pierce through my body. Then he smiled. If I hadn’t known what he was I might’ve been taken in by his easy manner and charm. Instead I grabbed Leif’s arm. “Hurry.”  
Suddenly the demon jumped on a table, scaring the supermodel and the others around her. His nails grew long, like pointed claws. 
People began to scream. 
We pushed toward the exit. I searched for Peter as I moved, wondering where he’d gone. The demon jumped to the table our group had been sitting at only moments before. He picked up a drink and chugged it down. Then threw the glass into the mirror behind the bar, causing it shatter. More people screamed. Several bouncers headed toward the demon. His smile grew bigger. 
“This is my favorite part,” I heard him say. It wasn’t that he spoke loud, but that his words seemed to pierce my insides. 
I shuddered with fear, but also with excitement. I’d never seen an actual demon up close. I’d seen plenty of Dark Moths and it was true that we all possessed the same powers as our demon sire, but we looked human. And while the demon tearing through the bouncers at the club appeared human when he wanted to, it was obvious that was not his true form. 
So what did he look like? 
“Alice,” Leif yelled. Everyone was at the exit and they were waving me over. But I didn’t feel right about leaving the humans who were fighting the demon to die.
I took the knife from my boot and ran toward the Envy demon. My pulse quickened. I was eager to fight. But before I reached him, someone pulled me back. 
“What do you think you’re doing?” Peter hissed in my ear. 
“Protecting the humans.”
“No. Get out.” 
While Peter and I argued, the demon noticed us. “I won’t fight you, girl. I’m here for the one called Eric.” He slashed through the final bouncer, jumped down onto the body and came to stand in front of Peter and me. “Besides, your sire would kill me if I laid a finger on you.” He pointed one of his clawed fingers in my face. “But oh, I’m tempted. You are luscious.” His voice was gravelly, not quite garbled, but it sounded like English was not his first language. “As for you,” he turned to Peter, then continued, “I can lay as many fingers on you as I want.” His clawed hand reached out to grab Peter’s neck. 
Without thinking, I sliced my knife through the demon’s fingers, cutting them off. 
He roared, bringing his hand into his chest. “Evil child. I look forward to the day when your sire comes after you. I’ll be an enthusiastic spectator for your death.”
“Who is he?” I shouted. 
He gnashed his teeth, held out his hand, and I watched his sleek, clawed hand regrow before my eyes. “Tell Eric I’m coming for him.” He cackled gleefully. “Let the games begin.” He jumped into the air. It looked like he would go through the roof, but he vanished. 



Five
Guidance From A Demon

“Alice Blackburn, what you just did…” Peter stopped and shook his head. “It was irresponsible, careless, and one of the most heroic deeds I’ve ever seen.” He pulled me into a quick hug, which shocked me. As trainees physical contact wasn’t a regular occurrence, especially between trainers and their students. “Let’s go find the others. They can’t be far.” 
I nodded, feeling numb. 
We exited the club and blended with the crowd. Swirling red and blue lights filled the sky. Police cars, a fire truck, and an ambulance had arrived on the scene. Crews helped those who’d been wounded while the police went inside. 
“Where are they?” I asked, searching the crowd for the rest of our group. 
“I’m guessing they went back to the parking lot. Let’s go.” 
Like spilled ink white paper, a thick darkness seemed to close in around us, roaring past the Spanish styled buildings, blocking out the stars and the three-quarter moon. 
“What’s happening?” I moved in closer to Peter.
“It’s the demon. He’s called his underlings. The game is afoot, whether we want it or not.”
And Peter was right. The impenetrable darkness wasn’t just night, but hordes of rat-like underling demons. With them they brought the strong stench of sulfur and decaying flesh.
  “And me without my sword,” I said sarcastically.  
Peter chuckled. “You’re such a warrior.” He searched our surroundings. “We need some cover.”
“Can the humans see the underlings?” I asked because the people were milling about like nothing was happening.
“No, not unless the demons want them to. Come on.” Peter took off running. “We need to get away from everyone,” he shouted as he ran headlong into the underlings. 
I started to follow but a dozen rats swooped in front of me. I gutted one and punched another as I tried car doors along the street. Finally I found an old beater and dove in, slamming a demon in the door when it shut. 
The rats were everywhere, so thick I couldn’t see anything else. I tried to locate Peter. Where are you? I hoped he was okay. 
The passenger side door opened and a guy got in. 
“What the— Get out,” I shouted. He’d scared me. For the briefest moment I’d believed he was a demon. 
“You realize they can get into the car if they want. You aren’t safe in here.” As he spoke one of the underlings noticed us and started through the windshield. The guy grabbed it by the neck with both hands and twisted until there was a pop. It immediately turned to dark ash. “One down, a million to go.” He smirked and reached through the glass, grabbing another. 
The move surprised me. It was obvious his abilities were strong and he’d been well trained. I hadn’t realized reaching through objects was possible. 
The underlings seemed to sense at once that we were in the car and began scratching their way in. 
“Take my hand.” He held it out. 
“No way.” I didn’t know the guy. I preferred to take my chances with the rats. 
“Okay, but I’m out.” He opened the door and disappeared into the sea of demons. 
I realized how wise he was in leaving. They had me pinned and were biting and clawing at my skin. “Get off of me.” I stabbed one in the neck and wrung another’s neck. Demon ash covered me and combined with the blood from the places where I’d been bitten.
I growled as one of them pulled my hair and another bit my cheek. My knife fell or was snatched from my hand and one of them sank its putrid teeth into my flesh. “That’s it.” In the past I’d rarely used the demon power. It hadn’t been necessary. But with a dozen demons pinning me inside the car, I needed it. Closing my eyes, I took a deep breath, feeling for the strength. It swelled and burst out from every one of my pores.  
Demons squealed in pain. Ash soaked me like rain in a thunderstorm. I opened my eyes and was surprised to see a cobalt light emanating off my skin and pushing outward. Every demon that came in contact with it was instantly incinerated.
I had no idea how I was doing it, but I wasn’t going to question it, not right them. Blood dripped from my cheek and onto my hand as I pushed the door open and climbed out. 
Humans were wandering around, still dazed from what’d happened in the club. One of the medical professionals came over and asked if I needed help. The shield that surrounded me and kept the demons at bay didn’t faze him. He walked right through it. 
“I’m fine,” I said and took off, heading in the direction of the parking garage.

Death and Envy

The underlings followed. They continued to attack my defense without regard for their own lives. I hoped whatever I was doing would continue to hold until I reached the others. 
I ran down the alley, past the grocery store and the bus stop. The guy who’d been in my car was in the middle of at least twenty demons, battling for his life. But it looked like he had the upper hand. He held a sword in each hand, mowing through them like they weren’t there. Green blood spattered against the glass enclosure, the cars, the sidewalk, and the street. 
His eyes found mine and he smirked before refocusing on the demons. It looked like the guy was having fun. Crazy. I shook my head, heading into the parking garage. If he were a Dark Moth warrior he would know where the entrance was and how to get himself to safety, and if he wasn’t it didn’t matter if he knew or not. No one but a Dark Moth who’d been deemed worthy could enter.  
The elevator was on the bottom level. I scampered to the edge of the concrete wall and peered over. Shouts and screams reached my ears. It sounded like my friends were losing. Flinging my legs over the edge, I jumped off and sailed down the five floors. My feet struck the floor with a light thud. 
“Alice.” Leif noticed me first. 
The Envy demon was there, as were dozens of underlings, and six other demons I’d never seen before. By the looks of them and the instruction I’d received during training, I surmised they were mid-level demons. 
Each stood four feet tall with skin that glistened like oily green snakes. Their eyes were small and beady. They had two slits for a nose, and a large mouth full of black, razor sharp teeth. Their tails were lined with spikes, like thorns on the stem of a rose. 
Peter fought with two of them while Steven, Leif, and the others battled the underlings. 
Except for Wendy. The Envy demon had Eric cornered and she fought four mid-level demons on her own, trying to reach her boyfriend. The markings on her hands were lit up bright red.
Wrath, I thought, impressed by her ferocity. 
I realized as I watched the scene unfold that the only Moths in real peril were Peter and Eric. The underlings and mid-level demons weren’t delivering lethal blows. It looked more like they were toying with them, keeping the trainees occupied while the Envy demon went after Eric.  
A quick appraisal told me Peter had his demons under control, but Eric had suddenly vanished. I ran over, using my shield to get past the mid-level demons. They shrieked as my shield fried their skin. 
“Alice,” Wendy cried, sounding relieved I was there to help. 
The Envy demon had grown to more than eight feet tall. He turned when Wendy spoke my name. His face changed into something not at all human. He had the same sharp black teeth, like the mid-level demons, but they were much larger. His mouth took up most of his face. 
It was with shocked sadness that I noticed a hand dangling from the demon’s teeth. “Alice Blackburn,” he hissed, pitching the rest of Eric’s hand into his mouth. It crunched down, grinding the bones as he chewed. 
Wendy screamed from behind me and I guessed she’d seen what I had. 
The remains of Eric sagged in the demons clawed hands. His head was still in tact and his eyes were open but lifeless. It looked like Eric had died in the middle of a scream. 
“No,” I whispered, unable to believe what I was seeing. It wasn’t that the rest of the trainees and I were close, but they were all the family I had. Seeing Eric killed in such a gruesome way infuriated me. I ran forward with no weapon but my hands and dove for the demon’s neck. 
The Envy demon dropped Eric and tried to swat me aside, but I grabbed hold of his hand and twisted, listening to the bones in his wrist break. At the same time I sent my elbow into his windpipe. He gasped as I spun in the air, moving my hands to his mouth where I took hold of his upper and lower jaws, ripping them apart. There was no pain when his teeth dug into my fingers. I felt nothing but white-hot rage as I tore him apart. 
Green blood covered me like I’d bathed in it. As the demon went down, his voice hissed inside my head: You’re stronger than the others. Seven times seven. But that means when your sire comes after you, the pain you’ll endure will be seven times seven. Remember that, Alice Blackburn.
“Who is my sire?” I shook at how close the answer was. The demon’s body turned to ash. With the Envy demon gone, the lower demons vanished as well. I guessed they’d gone back to the Underworld where they’d come from.  
“How did she do that?” Leif asked, his voice filled with awe. 
“I thought Dark Moths could only kill a greater demon after they’d killed their sire,” Steven added.
“Does that mean the Envy demon was her hear old dad as well as Eric’s?” Pam asked. 
“Did you see that shield around her? It protected her from even the mid-level demons,” Georgia said. “It was incredible.”  
I didn’t want to listen to anymore. Killing the Envy demon felt good, right, but that didn’t mean he’d been my sire. The demon had said seven times seven. Which demon was that? 
I didn’t have the answers, but at least my years of training had finally come to mean something. I’d experienced what destroying an upper-level demon felt like. And I knew the reason for my existence: to rid the world of every last demon. 
I turned my attention to Wendy, worried about what she might do. She’d gone over to what was left of Eric and had his face in her hands. Sobs tore through her. 
“I’m so sorry, Wendy,” I murmured. For some reason I felt responsible for his death. 
She shook her head. “I can’t believe it. He’s gone. No. No. No.” She seemed on the verge of a breakdown. I didn’t know what to do. 
Thankfully Peter took over.

A Wrath Party 

The ride down in the elevator was beyond somber. Wendy cried quietly against Peter. Leif and Steven carried Eric’s remains. I stood in the front, near the doors. Between the stench of death and the Envy demon’s blood, it was hard to breathe. 
When the door pinged open, I stepped out.
“Take the remains down to the infirmary. Heathcliff will know what to do,” Peter said as he practically carried Wendy. 
“Yes, sir.” Steven and Leif headed toward the hospital wing.
“Leif? Let Heathcliff know I’ll be down in a few minutes.”
“You got it.” 
Georgia and Pam quietly turned toward the dorms. 
“Alice, you coming?” Pam asked. 
“In a minute.” 
“Go on,” Peter urged. “I’ve got Wendy.” He gave me a once over. “And you need a shower.” 
I nodded dully. “Okay.” I entered my room after Pam. As I walked past the bed, a part of me longed to fall on it and sleep for a week. But that would be gross since I was covered in demon ash. So I edged into the bathroom, closing the door.
After I showered and dressed, there was a knock on the door. “Alice, it’s Peter.” 
“Is Wendy okay?” 
I opened the door. “Yes, Heathcliff gave her something to help her sleep, but that’s not why I’m here.” 
“Oh?” 
“It’s Wrythe. He would like to speak with you.”
My heart jumped into my throat. “Why?” I threw my towel into the hamper and sat on my bed, pulling on my black boots that matched the rest of my outfit. 
“I’m guessing he wants to know what happened tonight.” 
“So what do I tell him?” I grabbed my leather jacket and threw it on. 
“The truth, of course.” Peter smiled and put an arm around my shoulder. “He isn’t as scary as he seems.” 
“I’m not sure I believe you.” I gave him a sideways glance. Wrythe wasn’t a Moth I would ever want to cross in a dark alley. He made me more nervous than the demon I killed tonight. 
“Wrythe has been around a long time. He’s killed more demons than anyone. He knows how to protect regular Moths as well as the rest of our kind. So don’t shut him out. Tell him everything.” 
We came to the door that led to Wrythe’s personal chambers. Peter knocked. 
“Enter,” Wrythe commanded. 
“Remember what I said.” 
“I will.”
The door swung open. “Hello, Alice.” Wrythe sat on a large leather couch. He wore a pair of board shorts, flip-flops, and a tee shirt. He didn’t look like the leader of the most dangerous league of assassins the world had ever not known about.
I bowed, my eyes trained on my boots. “Hello, sir.” 
“Have a seat.” 
I scoped the room and took the leather chair that matched the couch. 
“Would you like a drink?” 
“No, thanks.” 
“So you want to get right to it?” He sat up and leaned forward. “Tell me what happened tonight.
For the next ten minutes I explained everything. Well, nearly everything, just as Peter told me to. When I finished, Wrythe picked up a glass that sat on the marble coffee table. “Do you think the Envy demon was your sire?” 
It was the moment of truth. Did I confess what the demon had said about the seven times seven? It felt like nothing and too big a secret at the same time. I needed to research and mull it over. I respected Wrythe as the leader of our society, but I didn’t trust him. I didn’t even know him. I shrugged. “I don’t know. It seems likely given the fact I was able to kill him.” 
Wrythe leaned back. “Our kind has existed for nearly as long as man has walked the Earth. As soon as demons realized what they could do, they began the awful game of creating and then killing their half-breed offspring. There’s no rhyme or reason to it. As with most evil in the world there doesn’t have to be.” He took another drink of whatever was in his glass before setting it back down. “I was one of the first to be born with the markings on my hands.” He turned his hands so they faced me. They were still red, the mark of Wrath, but they’d faded over the years. “I first realized I had powers about a week after I turned twenty-one. There was no society back then. I didn’t even know other Moths existed. My demon came after me with a vengeance I’d never seen. He was hungry for my murder. When my powers manifested it was a complete surprise to him as much as it was to me, which was how I was able to beat him.” He clasped his hands together. 
I crossed one leg over the other and waited for him to continue. His story was one I’d learned before I could read or write, but never had I heard the story from his own mouth. 
“Over the centuries others like me started to find each other. Instead of being chickens in a coup full of more chickens awaiting the inevitable fox to come and kill us, we finally became our own breed of fox, and we could kill just as easily.”
“Why do you think certain Moths began to receive the markings and powers?”
Our histories were full of theories and ideas, but nothing had ever been confirmed.
Wrythe continued, “I believe it’s because life always finds a way to go on. We’d been nothing more than play things to be toyed with and consumed, but our will to survive caused us to evolve.”
I liked that philosophy. Life finds a way… 
“Perhaps you’re our latest evolution, Alice. A Dark Moth that can kill any demon.”
Tell him what you know, my mind shouted. “Maybe you’re right,” was all I said. 
“Alice?” He came over to my chair. “You can tru—”
There was a sharp knock on the door. 
Wrythe straightened. “Enter.”
Two warriors came in. Between them slumped the guy who jumped into the car I’d been trying to steal.

Social Skills and Stitches

“We found him in the parking garage near the elevator,” one of the warriors said. 
Wrythe checked the backs of the guy’s hands. “He has no marks. Why would you think to bring him down here?” 
“He had this blade on him, not to mention all of the demon blood.” The other warrior produced a sword that had the marks of the Dark Moth on them. 
I felt compelled to add the information I had as well. “He was also able to see the demons. And he told me they would be able to get through the car… Maybe he’s a regular Moth who knows how to fight?” 
Wrythe smiled. “I believe you might be right.” He went back over to the couch. “Boys, take him to Heathcliff.” 
As they carried him out the door, Wrythe said, “Alice, I’m making this boy your responsibility. Once he’s healed, find out his story, discover what you can about him.”
I shivered internally, even though I didn’t know why. But I wanted to decline. Instead, reacted like a good little soldier. “Yes, sir.” 
“Good girl, now get going. Your mission starts now. Don’t leave his side until I instruct otherwise.” He went to the door and held it open, waiting for me to leave. 
“Thank you, sir.” I followed after the warriors and held open the double doors to the hospital wing. 
“Heathcliff!” one of the warriors shouted. 
The physician had been sitting at his desk looking into a microscope. At his name, he jumped with surprise and let out a very unmanly yelp. “Issac. Neeko.” He brushed his graying hair out of his face. “What have you brought me?”
“We think he’s a regular Moth, but he’s wounded and unconscious.”
“Well, get him on the table so I can have a look.” 
They got him up, laying him on his back.
The room was clean and sterile. Everything in its place. The walls, ceiling, and floor were stark white. Lights blazed so bright it looked like daytime. Rows of glass cupboards lined the wall on the left. I saw a heart, an ear, and the head of an unknown creature before I looked away. The back wall held two doors and in between them was Heathcliff’s workstation in the shape of a T, complete with three computer monitors, the microscope and other machines I wasn’t sure about. On the wall above the workstation were four rows of bookshelves filled with old books behind glass doors. To the right was a sink, more cupboards, another table, and some machines. In the center of the room was a stainless steel table on wheels. Below it was a drain. 
The room terrified me.   
“All right, now go,” Heathcliff said, interrupting my thoughts. “I’ve got work to do.” He shooed the warriors from the room. 
“You too, Alice.” 
“Wrythe ordered me to remain by his side.”
Heathcliff raised his thick, graying eyebrows. “Very well then. You can be my assistant.” He took some gauze from a glass container. “Get the boy’s shirt up. We need to see what kind of damage is under there.” 
I went over to the table. The guy’s black shirt was soaked in demon blood as well as some of his own. He looked like a Moth: deep black hair, tanned skin, tall and muscled. His eyes were closed, but I had a feeling when they were open, they’d be gray too. The same as everyone else’s. 
Not me though, I thought.  
“Hurry.”
“Right.” I rolled the edge of his shirt carefully upward. There was a large slash across his incredibly toned abs. It was bleeding profusely. He had smaller scrapes, welts, and teeth marks all over his torso, arms, neck, and face.
I’d tried to bind my fingers after my shower, but they were still bleeding. 
“Good green goodness. What happened to you?” He pulled the bandages from my fingers. “I can’t have you assisting me with your hands like that.” He led me over to the large sink and turned on the water. “Why didn’t you say something?” 
“I forgot,” I said shrugging. 
He mumbled something incoherent as he squirted something that smelled like antiseptic into my hands before moving back to the guy bleeding on the table. “Wash up. Use this towel to dry off. 
I rubbed my hands together, forcing myself not to wince. The liquid stung as it hit the places where the demons teeth went in. Fresh blood poured from my fingers as I removed the hardened, old stuff. 
 “Good. Now bandage up and put on a pair of gloves so you can help me attend to this poor sap. This looks like the work of a mid-level demon claw. It got him good.” 
“A claw did that?”
“It did.” As he spoke he dabbed at the wound. Once I had my gloves in place he handed the wad of gauze to me. “Carefully clean away as much blood as you can while I hook him up to a saline drip and blood. He’ll need both.” 
I wiped at the blood until the gauze was soaked. Grabbed another and continued until the area was as clean as I could get it. 
“My turn.” Heathcliff pushed me out of the way. He held a needle and thread in one hand and a clean swatch of gauze in the other. “This is going to hurt him. I don’t have any anesthetic and even if I did, Moths metabolize too quickly for it to do him any good.”
I’d guessed because of the way the guy fought the demons that he was at least a Moth, but I didn’t know for sure. He could’ve been human. 
Heathcliff went on, “I’ll need you to hold his hands.” 
“How? Where—” 
He shook his head. “Our instructors really need to work on giving you trainees some medical skills.” He pushed me toward the guy’s head. “Go up there, take his hands, and hold them tight until I’m finished stitching him up.” 
“Fine,” I said, thinking Heathcliff was right. But I grabbed the guy’s hands. They were large and warm. 
“Here we go.” Heathcliff stuck the needle into the guy’s skin. 
The guy groaned in pain. 
“Keep him steady.” 
I tightened my grip as Heathcliff fished the needle back through the skin. 
The guy groaned again, trying to roll onto his side. 
“Do not let him move.” 
I leaned over the guy, pressing my elbows into his wrists. 
As Heathcliff stuck his needle in once again, the guy moaned. And his eyes opened. 
“What the hell are you doing?” His eyes caught hold of mine. I glanced away, but not without first seeing that his eyes weren’t gray, and they weren’t like mine either. They were bright green. 
“Trying to patch you up, uh—what’s your name, kid?” Heathcliff stuck the needle that resembled a fish hook through his skin. 
“Ahhhh, damn that hurts.” The guy shuddered. 
I glanced down at him, trying not to stare, but I couldn’t help myself. 
“I’m Kade. Kade Everett.”
“Well, Mr. Everett. My name is Heathcliff.” Doc pulled the thread all the way through. 
“Good to meet you,” Kade said, gritting his teeth. 
“We’ll see if you still feel that way when I’m finished sewing up all of your wounds.” He winked. “The woman holding your hands is Alice.” 
“Hi Alice,” he said.
I smiled, wishing my face wasn’t heating up under his gaze. 
“This is going to hurt. Be strong and hold still,” Heathcliff continued.

Parole Officer 

For the next thirty minutes Heathcliff sewed up Kade’s large wound as well as cleaned out and stitched the smaller ones. I was impressed with how still and quiet Kade was. I felt his jaw clench and unclench several times, but he didn’t let out another sound. 
Finally, the doctor straightened. He rolled his shoulders, cracking his back. “Done.” 
The tension in Kade slowly relaxed. I removed my elbows from his wrists. 
He rubbed them gingerly. “You’re strong.”
“Sorry,” I muttered, but didn’t really mean it. 
Kade could tell. “Uh-huh.” 
“I’m going to keep you in the sick bay overnight.” Heathcliff helped Kade sit up as he spoke. “I’ll need to check the wounds tomorrow, but you should be pretty close to back to normal in a couple of days.”
Kade stood, but kept himself bent over. I had a feeling it had to do with the fifty or so stitches in his abdomen. 
Heathcliff took one of Kade’s arms and I took the other. We slowly walked him to one of the small rooms. The doctor pushed a button and the door slid open. There were two twin-sized beds with a small dresser near the footboard of each. Opposite the entrance was a tiny bathroom. “There are clothes in the dressers. Make yourselves comfy.” 
“What, we’re going to be roomies?” He glanced down at me. 
I literally felt my heart stop. “I guess so.” 
“Oh, I get it. You’re my PO.” 
“PO,” I asked, confused. I had no idea what it could mean. 
“Parole Officer,” he said, carefully sitting on the edge of the bed. “You’re going to keep me out of trouble, make sure I mind my manners, that sort of thing.” 
I chuckled lamely. “Something like that.” 
“Cool.” 
“Can he get cleaned up,” I asked, eyeing his disgusting clothes. 
“Yeah, but he’s going to need your help.” Heathcliff opened the door and started laughing. “Good luck with that.” 
I nearly died of embarrassment. “Thanks.” 
As he was about to leave, I said, “I need a pair of scissors.”
“Sure thing.” He left a moment and then came back. “Do I want to know what you’re going to do with these?” 
I took the scissors. “Yeah, I’m going to cut off his shirt.”
“Good plan,” he said and left, letting the door slide closed. 
“Ohhhhhh, you’re putting the moves on me now?” Kade smiled, showing off his sensual mouth. 
I was mesmerized by his lips. They seemed to call to me. Dork! “No, but that shirt is a mess. It needs to be incinerated.” 
He glanced down. “This is my favorite shirt. You can’t destroy it.”
“Whatever,” I snorted, coming at him with the scissors. 
He held up his hands and then winced. “Ouch.” 
“I’m going to get that shirt off. Don’t try and stop me.” 
“Go ahead.” 
“Thanks.” I knelt in front of him and grabbed the bottom edge. “Hold still,” I said, quickly glancing at his face. I’d removed my gloves after helping Heathcliff, but now wished I’d kept them on. Carefully, I cut straight up the middle, trying to avoid the demon blood. When I reached the neck, he tilted his chin upward and I cut straight through his collar. Then set the scissors on the floor. 
“Try to go easy on me,” he said. 
I snorted. “Don’t you wish.” Nervously, I leaned up on my knees and pushed his shirt open. Kade was all muscles and warmth and strength. Amongst all the blood and gore still on him was a light scent of cinnamon. 
“Take a picture, it lasts longer.” 
“Shut—” I glanced up and stopped. His eyes seemed to glow in the dim light of the room. “Up.” 
He leaned down and kissed me lightly on the mouth. The move wasn’t anything big or grand, but his lips against mine sent a rush of emotions through me and I would swear there was a spark. It was as though I’d been in darkness and suddenly the lights within me had flickered on. I gasped and fell back. 
There was shock on Kade’s face for a moment before he glanced away. “I didn’t mean to scare you.” He held out his hand. I ignored it and got up off the floor. “Can you assist me into the bathroom? I want to get cleaned up.”
“Uh, sure.” I helped him up. In the bathroom I put the toilet seat down. “Sit.” While he did, I grabbed a washcloth and ran it under hot water. “Let me get your back.” 
“Wow, a full service parole officer. Sweet.” 
I ignored him and quickly scrubbed off the blood and dirt. 
“Don’t forget to get behind my ears,” he joked. 
I punched him. Then tossed the washcloth onto his lap. “Finish it yourself.”

After the Funeral

Pam unlocked our door and pushed it open. She quickly fell onto her bed and crossed her hands over her face. 
“Are you okay?” I asked, even though I knew she wasn’t. Neither was I. Images of Eric’s hand dangling from the demon’s mouth kept driving their way in.  
Attending Eric’s funeral had been difficult. I’d seen enough television to know that while they were somber they were supposed to celebrate the life of the person who’d died. We had nothing to celebrate. 
Once we were found and plucked from whichever foster home we’d been living in at the time, we were brought to the Dark Moth compound and trained from morning until night every single day. There were rarely field trips or any kind of fun. Our sole purpose for living was to bring down our demon parent and hopefully save several hundreds or thousands of regular Moths in the process. 
If we lived, it was to serve. 
If we died as Eric had, there was no celebration. His life was just over. 
“I’m fine.” Pam sniffled and wiped her eyes with the back of her hand. “I’ll be twenty-one in three days.” She sat up and removed her shoes. “What we saw—what happened to Eric—that’s going to be me soon.” She unzipped her black dress and pulled it over her head. “I’m not ready to die yet. I haven’t done anything.” Tears leaked from her eyes. 
I understood exactly what she meant. My birthday was coming up too. “You’re not going to die. I won’t let you.” 
Pam smiled, but it was full of cruelty. “I appreciate your courageous words, Alice. But no one believes you slayed that demon because of skill. It was a fluke and that shield or whatever you used.” She pulled on her gray training pants and matching gray shirt. Then put on her black combat boots. “I would like to know how you did that. Will you show me?” 
I pulled off my black dress and tossed it on the floor, kicking my heels on top of it. “If I knew how I did it, I totally would.” 
“Figures,” she said, slamming the door shut behind her. 
I went over to my bed and lay down. I wasn’t trying to be difficult or keep a skill from my fellow trainees. In all truth I’d tried to make myself produce the shield several times since that fateful night, but I hadn’t been able to make it happen. 
There was a knock at the door. “Alice? Are you in there? We need to train.” 
It was Kade. We’d spent every moment together over the last three days. I’d even slept in the sick bay with him. Coming to my room to dress and undress for the funeral and using the bathroom had been my only alone time. 
He was a nice enough guy, but it felt like Wrythe was punishing me for some reason. Had I done something wrong? I’d wanted to ask him the question on more than one occasion, but there hadn’t been an opportunity. 
“Give me a minute.” I jumped off my bed and quickly dressed in a black training outfit. Laced and tied my boots and then went to the door, opening it. “Hi, Kade.” 
He was dressed from head to toe in black, like me. Yet on him it looked faultless. 
“You ready?”
“Sure.” I shut the door and walked beside him down the hall. 
“How was the funeral?” He gave me a sidelong glance. 
I shook my head. “Depressing.” Kade hadn’t been invited. Wrythe and the others didn’t trust him. He’d said he was a Moth who’d secretly trained on his own, and that even though he didn’t possess any demon power, he’d killed his demon sire. He claimed to have grown up in Wonderland, gone to school, and held a job, just like the humans who dwelt above ground. 
He also claimed to be twenty-five though it was hard to tell. For all I knew he could’ve been ninety. Moths stopped aging once we reached maturity, which was twenty-one. For most it was the year of our death as well. 
Part of me was tired. Another part felt restless. If I were going to die in a few weeks, I wanted to really live first, like so many of the humans I’d seen in television shows and movies, like in the books I’d read. I wanted an experience that had nothing to do with demons or Dark Moths. “Tell me something about you.” 
He raised an eyebrow. “Like what?” 
I shrugged. “Anything… A story. Tell me what you did for a living. What was your job?” 
He laughed. “It wasn’t all that interesting. I was a mechanic.” 
I pondered the word. “You fixed cars?” 
“Cars. Boats. Motorcycles. If it’s got an engine, I can fix it.” 
“Did you go to school to learn your craft?”
“Not any further than high school. My foster dad was cool though. He taught me about engines, how they work, how to make them go again.” 
“It sounds like you enjoyed your job.”
He shrugged. “Sure. It isn’t glamorous and I have permanent grease stains on my hands and under my nails.” He held out his hands to let me see. “But doing so pays the bills and keeps me busy.” 
We’d reached the training room. The door slid open and we walked through. Pamela was in the corner shooting arrows into several different targets. 
“How did you get mixed up in our fight the other night?” 
He picked up one of the Dark Moth swords. “I was there.”
“Oh?”
“Yes, even greasy mechanics like to go out once in a while.” 
“And you saw the demon?” I’d asked him to tell me about that night more than once already, but something didn’t sit right about his answer.
Kade tossed the blade back and forth between both hands. “As I’ve told you already, it wasn’t until the demon began fighting the bouncers that I realized what was happening.”
“Why didn’t you try to help?” Doing so seemed as natural as breathing. At least to me. 
“If there’s one thing I’ve learned over the years, it’s that it is better to stay out of it.” He went to the center of the room so we’d have plenty of space to spar. “Ready?”
I picked up the sword I normally used and took my place a few feet in front of him. “Always.” 
Kade leaned in, but at the last second dove into me, knocking me to the ground. 
“What the hell? Are you getting fresh with me?” 
“Your roommate shot an arrow our way.” He held it up in his hand. 
I scrambled to my feet. Pam was an excellent shot, which meant she sent the arrow at us on purpose. “Do you have a problem? Trying to kill us?”
Her eyes were blurry with tears. “Sorry, Alice. It was an accident. The arrow got away from me.” 
Kade jumped to his feet. “Accident my arse.” 
That was my thinking, but I didn’t want to believe it. 
“Be right back.” Kade jogged over to Pam and handed her the arrow. They exchanged words, but I didn’t hear what was said. 
When he came back, he seemed aggravated. 
“How’s your injury,” I asked. It didn’t seem to bother him at all anymore. 
Kade lifted his shirt. The skin where the large cut had been was healed and puckered pink. In a few days that would be gone as well. “Better,” he said, putting his shirt back down. 
“Good.” My cheeks warmed and I looked away. 
Kade tapped me on the shoulder with the edge of his sword. “So you don’t have to take it easy on me today.”
I faced him again. “About time.” 
We sparred for the next thirty minutes, until I finally got the courage to ask him what I’d been meaning to ask since we met. “It’s obvious from the lack of markings on your hands that you aren’t a Dark Moth, so what are you?” 
Kade was breathing heavily and so was I. “I wondered when you’d ask.” He slid his sword home with the rest of the training swords and plopped onto the mat. 
I did the same, waiting. “Well, what? Are you a regular Moth?” I urged when he didn’t continue. 
He crossed his legs, resting his elbows on his knees. “I’m… no, I’m neither.” 
“Vague much? Why won’t you tell me?” I spread my legs out into the splits and stretched. 
Kade’s eyes went wide and I blushed. 
The bell rang indicating dinner.  


 

Eleven
He Stole My Tart

Kade was quiet, witty, and had a serious love of tacos. If we had eggs and toast for breakfast, he stuck the eggs on the toast and wrapped it like a taco before eating it. Whatever meat and veggies we were served for dinner were stuffed between two halves of a roll and eaten like a taco. For snacks he put cucumber into a tortilla or shrimp or tomatoes or corn. It was crazy and strangely endearing. 
He was also very regimented. Each morning he woke, stretched, and took a cold shower. Heathcliff had us stay in the sick bay for only one night and then we were moved to a regular dorm room. It was in the trainers’ hall closest to the door. 
I figured I would tire of being in such close proximity to a person for so long, but instead I grew to like his silly stories and the way his voice lilted on certain words. He still hadn’t answered any of the important questions, and I was becoming frustrated. 
Kade could fight better than anyone, especially as he continued to heal. Peter sparred with him a couple of times and I could tell he let Peter win. It was the same with weapons training and hand-to-hand combat. Kade held back. I wondered why, but each time I tried to bring it up he changed the subject.  
I knew the feeling about holding back. Not once had I fully freed my demon power. It surged within, like boiling lava waiting to erupt. 
Over dinner on the third night, I finally blurted all of the questions Wrythe wanted answered at once: “Have you killed your demon sire? Which of the royalty demons is yours?” My guess kept changing. At first I believed he was Envy, then Pride, then when he beat Peter the first time I thought Wrath. But I had no idea. 
Kade offered me a secret smile. “Which do you think?” 
I dropped my fork. “Gluttony?” 
He rolled his eyes playfully. “No.” 
“He was vague about everything, except the personal stuff, like where he worked. 
“Sloth?”
“No.” He chuckled. 
I picked up a roll and took a bite. “Don’t you want to return home? Aren’t there people who must be missing you?” 
He took a bite of his cherry tart. “There’s no one,” he finally said after he’d swallowed. 
I sensed sadness in his voice and realized that even after nearly four days together I knew very little about him. “What about your job? Don’t you need to go to work?” 
He shrugged and put the rest of the tart in his mouth. 
It was apparent he didn’t want to talk about it, but I couldn’t be put off so easily. “What’s the name of the place where you work?”
Pam and Georgia had been talking, but at my question, they stopped and focused their attention on Kade.  
Steve and Gilbert also quieted. 
The attention didn’t seem to affect Kade though. He kept chewing, swallowed, took a long drink of his water, and then looked at me. “The Caterpillar’s Place.”
“That’s a silly name.” I dunked my roll in gravy before taking a small bite. 
“Well, that’s Wonderland for you.” He reached over and picked up my tart. “You gonna eat this?” Without waiting for a response he shoved half of it in his mouth. 
I shook my head. I wasn’t fond of the fruit, but he could’ve waited for me to give him permission. “Not now.” 
“Oh, come on. I know you don’t like cherries.” 
“Still,” I said, pushing the dessert plate toward him. “Where are your manners?” 
Kade stuck the other half in his mouth, picked up his cloth napkin, and dabbed each side of his lips. 
I picked at the green beans still on my dinner plate. 
When he swallowed, he said, “In this life you have to take what you want and damn the consequences.”
His words shocked me and I gasped. It felt like something had changed within him. “Really?” 
“Very few humans and even fewer demons will wait for you to ask for what you want. They will take without remorse.”
I didn’t like that. “I don’t believe you.”
“It doesn’t matter whether you believe me or not. That’s the truth and you’d do well to listen.” He stacked his dessert plate as well as mine on top of his dinner plate, tossed his napkin over them, and then stood. “I’m done. You ready?” 
I shook my head. “No, I’m not finished.” I stabbed a bean and put it in my mouth. It was cold and didn’t taste very good, but I wasn’t going to be bossed. His strange attitude was annoying. 
“Fine. I’ll see you later then.” 
We weren’t supposed to be apart, but I didn’t care. I watched as Kade put his dinner stuff on the conveyor belt and prepared to leave the dining room. 
Wrythe walked in. His eyes sought out Kade’s. “You, come with me.” He then found me and bid me follow. 
“Great.”  



Twelve
Down, Down, Down The Tree

I caught up with Kade. He gave me a serious look before turning his attention to Wrythe’s back. I continued to stare up at him, unable to believe the strange and varied emotions coursing through my body. 
Kade wasn’t as tall as the other males, but still head and shoulders taller than me. “What do you think he wants?” I whispered.
He gave me a sad smile. “We’ll know soon enough, won’t we?” 
Wrythe walked to the elevator we’d ridden to go up into Wonderland a few nights ago. Once we were inside, he pulled a key from his pocket. Stuck it into the keyhole and turned. Instead of going up, we went down. I hadn’t known there was anything below us. We were so far down already. 
“Where are we going?” 
Wrythe didn’t answer and my heart sped up. Fear was an emotion I’d schooled myself to control, but at our King’s strange behavior, I was afraid. 
The elevator stopped and the door slid open. 
“Stay close.” Wrythe glanced over his shoulder, making sure I heard him. 
“Okay.” 
The air was chilly and I could see my breath. Wind ghosted past, causing the edges of my hair to tickle my neck. Our footsteps echoed making it obvious we were surrounded by rock. It was dark too. No light guided our way. My demon power shuddered to life and I could see well enough to know we walked along a concrete path. 
Doors lined the hallway, but I had no desire to know what was being held behind them. 
When we reached the end of the hall, we turned left and continued down another hall with more doors, exactly like the first. It was our fourth left turn that I realized something was off. We should’ve come full circle, but we hadn’t. Though the halls looked the same, they felt different. The air felt thinner.  
On the seventh turn, Wrythe came to a stop at a dead end. At first it appeared to be nothing more than a rock wall, until he placed his hand upon it. Then it ignited red and the outline of a door appeared. He leaned his bodyweight against it and the door swung in.  “After you,” he said, stepping to the side once it fully opened. 
A new kind of terror had sunk like a heavy weight into my stomach. I had no idea what was about to happen. Whatever it was, it would end badly. Of that I was sure. But I went in after Kade because Wrythe had ordered it. 
The room we entered was dimly lit. Then thousands of candles sparked to life. They sat on darkened candelabras thick with hardened wax. More candles lined shelves, and rested on every flat surface. The walls were covered in what appeared to be sheer white curtains. 
Directly in front of us stood six figures dressed in covered robes, each dressed to match six of the seven deadly demons of royalty. A large hood swallowed their faces, making it impossible to tell who was underneath, though I believed I had an idea. They were my instructors, each one representing the demon who had been their sire. The one in the purple hood lifted his head and Peter’s face came into view. The others followed. Wrythe took his place in the center. He’d put on a red robe. 
Without meaning to I stepped closer to Kade, which made no sense. I’d known the men and women in the robes since I’d first come to the compound at the age of twelve. 
“Kade Everett. You have been summoned.”
“For what purpose, Society? I’ve played by your rules, done as you’ve asked, allowed the girl to keep a close eye on me.” 
He gave me a quick look and I glared. He hadn’t allowed me to do anything. 
“I’ve given you no cause for concern.”
“This is true, Wrythe. He has been nothing but respectable,” Peter said.
“Yes, but we’re no closer to knowing what he is. He’s told the girl nothing about his heritage,” the trainer Lily said. Her gray eyes cut to me and felt like knives against my soul. “Unless the girl has developed feelings for the boy and no longer is on our side.” 
How dare she? Why would she say such a thing? 
“Fine, I’ll tell you what I am, if that will make you happy.” Kade took another step toward the seven. 
“No,” Wythe growled. “It’s too late for that. The only way to discover what you truly are is for you to complete the Trial of Three.”



Thirteen
Decision and Choice

 My head shot up at that. I’d read about the Trial of Three. They would test the Moth physically, emotionally, and spiritually to discover a Moth’s true purpose. 
“Sire, it would serve your Society better if you did not make me do this.” 
“He dares to speak to us with such arrogance?” Gillian, the Greed warrior demanded. 
“We should kill him and end this charade. It doesn’t matter what he is or isn’t because the fact remains that he most definitely is not a Dark Moth. And we cannot have him in our midst any longer.” The Lady Edith, sired by Envy and devastated at the loss of Eric spoke severely. 
“If that is your wish, I will succumb.” Kade bowed low. 
“No!” I shouted. “Don’t kill him.” 
I placed my body between Kade and the Society. 
“Alice,” Wrythe demanded. “It is not your place to come between the Society and our decision.” 
“Perhaps we should send her back up. She’s still young.” That was Peter who spoke. 
Wrythe shook his head. “Perhaps…”
“I’m not going anywhere without Kade.” I had no idea what had gotten into me, but something deep inside demanded I fight for him the way he’d fought against those demons the other night. 
“Give her the trials as well,” Sabrina said. “We’ve long said she should face them in order to discover the truth of her sire and her true path. It will help her prepare.” 
“We swore never to force the trials on a trainee. She won’t be able to handle the weight of the experience. 
But I felt Wrythe considering it. He believed it would be a good idea and so did I, even if the thought terrified me. “It’s all right, your Highness. I volunteer to face the trials.” 
Kade glanced over at me. “We will face them together, Alice Blackburn.” 
I nodded, giving him a secret smile. It was the right thing to do. I felt it. 
“Then it’s settled.” Wrythe walked over to an altar covered in candles and pushed them aside, knocking them to the floor. They flickered and burned out. “Alice, come and lie down.” 
As I did, he walked over to another altar. They were side by side. Once the candles had been removed, Wrythe motioned to Kade. “Lie down.” 
“I will. But know this. It would be better for everyone if I simply tell you what I am.”
Wrythe glanced back at the Society. “What say you?” 
“The trials,” they said in unison. 
Kade shook his head. “As you wish, Wrythe, King of the Dark Moth Society.” 
Wrythe stood back and Edith moved between the two altars. “Take each other’s hand,” she said. 
I held out mine and Kade took it, giving it a slight squeeze. Whatever was about to happen, it was going to be bad. I could feel it in my very bones. They seemed to tremble with my fear, clattering noisily. Edith produced a golden cord and bound Kade’s wrist with mine. 
Then she spoke words I didn’t understand, like a poem. I was suddenly tired. Too tired to keep my eyes open. So I closed them, thinking I could rest until the time came to start the trials. 
And that’s when I saw him, the white rabbit with eyes the color of Kade’s. He pulled a watch from his white vest pocket. 
“I’m late.” Then he dashed through the tall grass. I hopped off the altar, quickly searching for the Society but seeing none of them. The altar Kade had been on was gone, too. 
So I went after the rabbit. He jumped into a hole. 
“Wait,” I called. When I reached the opening, I fell to my knees and peered inside. “Hello? Rabbit!” 
He didn’t answer, so I did the most logical thing I could think of at the time. I climbed in after him.
